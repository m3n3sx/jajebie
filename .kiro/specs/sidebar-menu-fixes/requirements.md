# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues with the WordPress admin sidebar menu functionality in the Live Admin Styler plugin. The sidebar menu currently has several problems including non-functional collapse behavior, incomplete styling application, visibility issues with submenus, missing visual effects, and unwanted scrollbars. These issues significantly impact the user experience and prevent the plugin from working as intended.

The fixes will be implemented through improvements to the existing CSS generation system and JavaScript DOM manipulation, utilizing the current AJAX-based live preview architecture without requiring REST API integration.
