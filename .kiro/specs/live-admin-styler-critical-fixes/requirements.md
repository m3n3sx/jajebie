# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues in the Live Admin Styler WordPress plugin v1.2.0 that prevent core functionality from working properly. The plugin currently suffers from broken live preview functionality, JavaScript errors, AJAX failures, and CSS generation problems that render the plugin unusable for end users. These issues stem from improper event handling, missing script dependencies, incorrect nonce validation, and flawed CSS output generation.

The fixes will restore full functionality while maintaining WordPress coding standards, security best practices, and performance optimization. The solution will implement proper debounced event handling, enhanced error management, and robust AJAX communication to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want the live preview functionality to work immediately when I change any styling option, so that I can see the visual changes in real-time without having to save settings first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user changes any styling option (color, size, font, etc.) THEN the system SHALL apply the changes to the admin interface within 300ms
2. WHEN multiple rapid changes are made THEN the system SHALL debounce the updates to prevent performance issues
3. WHEN a live preview update occurs THEN the system SHALL not interfere with the user's ability to continue making changes
4. WHEN the live preview fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message and allow retry functionality
5. WHEN the user navigates between tabs THEN the system SHALL maintain live preview functionality across all settings sections

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want all JavaScript functionality to work without console errors, so that the plugin interface operates smoothly and doesn't interfere with other WordPress functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin loads THEN the system SHALL initialize all JavaScript components without throwing any console errors
2. WHEN event handlers are attached THEN the system SHALL use proper namespacing to prevent conflicts with other plugins
3. WHEN JavaScript errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and provide fallback functionality
4. WHEN the page is unloaded THEN the system SHALL properly clean up all event listeners and timers
5. WHEN jQuery UI components are used THEN the system SHALL verify their availability before initialization

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want all AJAX requests to work reliably with proper security validation, so that my settings are saved correctly and the system remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AJAX request is made THEN the system SHALL include valid WordPress nonce tokens for security
2. WHEN nonce validation fails THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the nonce and retry the request
3. WHEN AJAX requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and retry options
4. WHEN multiple AJAX requests are made simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle them without conflicts
5. WHEN the user lacks sufficient permissions THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want the CSS generation to work correctly for all styling options, so that my customizations are properly applied to the admin interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS is generated THEN the system SHALL produce valid CSS syntax without errors
2. WHEN color values are processed THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all color inputs
3. WHEN numeric values are used THEN the system SHALL ensure proper units and ranges are applied
4. WHEN CSS selectors are created THEN the system SHALL use appropriate specificity to override WordPress defaults
5. WHEN CSS generation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want proper error handling and user feedback throughout the interface, so that I understand what's happening and can resolve any issues that arise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly notifications with clear explanations
2. WHEN operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators to inform the user
3. WHEN operations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation feedback
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL detect offline/online status and adjust behavior accordingly
5. WHEN critical errors happen THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for troubleshooting while showing simplified messages to users

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want the plugin to be compatible with WordPress 6.0+ and PHP 8.0+, so that it works reliably in modern WordPress environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin runs on WordPress 6.0+ THEN the system SHALL use current WordPress APIs and coding standards
2. WHEN the plugin runs on PHP 8.0+ THEN the system SHALL handle all PHP 8.0+ specific features and deprecations properly
3. WHEN WordPress core updates occur THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with admin interface changes
4. WHEN other plugins are active THEN the system SHALL not conflict with common WordPress plugins
5. WHEN the plugin is activated/deactivated THEN the system SHALL handle all setup and cleanup operations correctly

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want optimal performance with efficient resource usage, so that the plugin doesn't slow down my admin interface or consume excessive server resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS is generated THEN the system SHALL cache results to avoid repeated processing
2. WHEN JavaScript events fire THEN the system SHALL use debouncing to prevent excessive processing
3. WHEN AJAX requests are made THEN the system SHALL optimize payload size and frequency
4. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement cleanup routines to prevent memory leaks
5. WHEN the plugin processes large amounts of data THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate limits and validation
